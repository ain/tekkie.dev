<p>The more specific the particular technology, the more expertise it requires. The same goes for the issues. The more specific they are, the harder it gets to resolve. It is always a great relief to find an article on a web by someone who has already been there and made it work. In these very considerations flash tekkie is introducing various Flash development issues and, first and foremost, fixes and workarounds.</p>
<p>Alongside the Flash development articles there is a whole spectrum of topics from various fields of IT and, why not, computer arts for instance.</p>
<p>If you have an idea of something that may fit in flash tekkie's articles, you are most welcome to get in <a href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/contact">contact</a>.</p>
