<p>Seemingly there's no need to optimise a Tween in AS3, but what about an application that accommodates a lot of different (randomly) moving particles? That will surely affect CPU load aiming to trouble a user who may be typing, dragging or selecting. As long as UX matters, optimisation techniques matter.</p>
