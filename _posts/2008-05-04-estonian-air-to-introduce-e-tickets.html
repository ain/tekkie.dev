<p><img class="teaser-image--left teaser-image--w96" title="Boeing of Estonian Air" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/boeing-of-estonian-air.png" alt="Boeing of Estonian Air" />As of 5th of May the customers of Estonian Air don't have to hassle with printed tickets and can use the automated check-in procedure. Alongside these changes a new website with a new booking system and client area is to be introduced over the next week.</p><!--more-->
<p>For e-tickets Tallinn Airport (IATA: TLL) will feature automated ticket machines that are considered to speed the check-in significantly. One of the bonuses is also the fact that e-ticket can't be lost and it doesn't cost anything to make a duplicate of the ticket which previously cost around 30€. <br />
Whose who have previously bought the ticket, can still check in with their old tickets.</p>
<p>With obvious visual changes the new site will also feature web-based check-in and additional languages:</p>

<p>As the site is currently undergoing an update, Mr Mart Lubi, Chief Pilot of Estonian Air, will walk you through the changes until the site's functionality will be restored. </p>
