If the credit card used to subscribe to BrowserStack's Live plan expired, the chances are you'd face $99 monthly to prolong. There are 4 simple steps to get back on the $29 plan.<!--more-->

Earlier this week I had an unpleasant surprise on BrowserStack where credit card expiry blocked the service and the only presented option to prolong appeared to be the $99 monthly Automate Pro package.

After [a fair bit of sarcasm on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tekkie/status/958347735962275842), @BrowserStack got back to me in a private email with __4 steps that helped to get back on the $29 monthly Live plan__:

1. Sign out of your paid BrowserStack account. (Mandatory)
2. Navigate to our pricing page through [here](https://www.browserstack.com/pricing)
3. Select the Live plan. On the next page, make sure you select your preferred billing cycle.
4. Type in the username and password of the account. The _Sign me up_ button will change to _Sign me in_. Click on this button to sign-in and complete your purchase.

It remains unclear why this rather controversial dance is necessary, but in any case it can save one $70 monthly.
