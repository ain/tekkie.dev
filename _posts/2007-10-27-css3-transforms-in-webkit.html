<p>In addition to <a title="WebKit is leading the run for CSS3" href="/browsers/webkit-is-leading-the-run-for-css3">Web Fonts</a> recently introduced in WebKit, there's now a rudimentary support for CSS transforms as well. As of now you can scale, rotate, skew and translate the boxes in the latest nightly of WebKit.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Even though this is a WebKit-specific development at this point, the similar functionality will definitely be there in forthcoming CSS specifications presumably under the rotation and rotation-point property for instance.</p>
<p>Such a functionality would save developers a lot of time on image processing or scripting and provide a lightweight solution for a number of situations.</p>
<p>To illustrate the point, please find the image below and click it for the live test case:</p>
<p><a title="CSS3 transforms in WebKit" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/tmp/css3_transform_sample.html"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css3_transforms_in_webkit1.png" alt="CSS3 transforms in WebKit" /></a></p>
<p>Transform is available through <strong>-webkit-transform</strong> property. For example to scale an image to 145% and rotate it by 45 degrees you could use the following code:</p>
<p><code>img {-webkit-transform:rotate(45deg) scale(1.45);}</code></p>
<p>Alternatively you may also add skew primitive and flip the image by 300 degrees as well:</p>
<p><code>img {-webkit-transform:rotate(45deg) scale(1.45) skew(-300deg);}</code></p>
