<p><a href="http://obfuscatr.flashbit.net/" title="obfuscatr - email address obfuscator">obfuscatr</a> is the email address obfuscator.  Its purpose is to obfuscate the email address in a way it couldn't be reached by the bots crawling the web for emails.<br />
<!--more--><br />
By the latest studies over 97% of the spam is sent to addresses that have been posted on public websites. Such addresses are naked.</p>
<p>'Naked email' stands for an email that is readable to various bots, including Googlebot. So email harvesting bots, that grab the email for a spammer, don't even have to reach the site the email resides but rather get it from Google.</p>
<p>A lot of people prevent that by posting their email addresses like me [at] mydomain.com or just replace the @ sign with a graphic. Does it help? Well, if it's a bot, automated tool relying on programming, would it be that hard to modify its search criteria to also match the addresses formatted as me [at] mydomain.com? Please also note that spamming has a fully commercial background these days.</p>
<p>But let us think different. Any web developer familiar with Search Engine Optimization techniques should know that Googlebot doesn't fancy client-side scripting, e.g. Javascript. So any content that is being rendered client-side would be skipped by Googlebot. That is exactly a half of what obfuscatr does to an email — it provides you with a script that is rendered client-side. Another half consists of hexadecimal encoding.</p>
<p>To use obfuscatr just paste or type in your email, click 'Obfuscate!' and it will generate you a code that you can use on a web  without exposing the email. To a visitor it will look proper. To a bot — not really.</p>
<p>obfuscatr is available as a <a href="http://obfuscatr.flashbit.net/download.html" title="Download obfuscatr">Dashboard widget</a> for Mac OS X users. Users on other platforms can use the <a href="http://obfuscatr.flashbit.net/obfuscate.html" title="Obfuscate your email!">online</a> version.</p>
