Another interesting Web2 venture you might want check out is <strong>iusethis</strong>.<!--more-->

iusethis is a new way for you to organize your applications as well as discover new ones. You can also use it to check if your apps are up-to-date and share your application list with mates.

What iusethis basically does, is that it rates applications in a democratic way counting people who use it. The whole site uses a lot of new technology and is remarkably well set up.

It is also a good platform to promote the application of yours.
