excerpt: Sometimes you need to share sensitive data securely. One possibility would be to use password protected packing like ZIP or RAR. But that wouldn't be very maintenable, which is why macheads use DMG.

One possibility would be to use password protected packing like ZIP or RAR. But that wouldn't be flexible in terms of further editing which is why macheads use DMG.</p><!--more-->
<p>As in the previous <a href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/tag/dmg" title="Disk image related articles at flash tekkie">DMG-related articles</a> Disk Utility comes in handy. You can find Disk Utility in Applications &gt; Utilities.</p>
<p>On the toolbar of Disk Utility, there's icon for the New Image, clicking on which produces the dialogue box:</p>
<p><a href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-9.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-247" title="New Image dialogue in Disk Utility" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-9-150x125.png" alt="New Image dialogue in Disk Utility" width="150" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>As we go through the entries, the specs for the new password protected DMG disk image are following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Save As</strong> sets the file name of the image file, e.g. My private data.dmg.</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> sets the location of the image file.</li>
<li><strong>Volume name</strong> sets the name of the volume as it would appear in Finder later<img style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;" title="DMG volume name in Finder" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-10.png" alt="DMG volume name in Finder" width="175" height="107" /></li>
<li><strong>Volume size</strong> sets the estimated size of the DMG file. If you are going to share stuff, you probably know what would the maximum size be. For the document files you'd be safe with 10 MB.</li>
<li><strong>Volume Format</strong> is the disk format for the image that you may safely leave untouched.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong> refers to the file encryption strength as we set the password. 256-bit AES encryption would make a nice choice here.</li>
<li><strong>Partitions</strong> would be fine with Single partition.</li>
<li><strong>Image Format</strong> is best to remain at read/write in order to enable later changes, e.g. if you need to add files into the image in future.</li>
</ol>
<p>With everything filled in, hitting the Create button will create the image file at your given location and prompt you for the password:</p>
<p><a href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-11.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-249" title="Password prompt of the Disk Utility" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-11-150x116.png" alt="Password prompt of the Disk Utility" width="150" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure to <strong>uncheck</strong> the <strong>Remember password in my keychain</strong> checkbox if you are willing to be prompted for the password at all times, even on your own machine. Otherwise, if anyone opens the DMG file on the machine it was created on, they would not be prompted for the password because it would be pulled off the Keychain automatically.</p>
<p>As you have created the DMG file, you can open it and drag your sensitive files to it in Finder. Once you have completed, make sure to unmount the image from the eject button by the image name Â <img title="Eject volume button in Finder" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-12.png" alt="Eject volume button in Finder" width="23" height="20" /> .</p>
