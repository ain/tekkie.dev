<p>Too many developers cut on error handling by providing a very raw framework that is incapable of handling exceptions. It looks like it's saving a day but in a long run it's probably going to cost badly.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Flash developers have all the means necessary to get errors properly handled at the required level. Similarly to Java for instance, there is <strong>try...catch...finally</strong> statement available in ActionScript.</p>
<p>Yet it's not used, on the contrary, there are many applications that go all the way procedural and resolve exceptions with endless if statements. So it's a maintenance issue as well. Things are not as readable as they could be.</p>
<p>To emphasize the usage of <strong>try...catch...finally</strong> statement, here's a very straightforward code to illustrate the point:</p>
<pre lang="actionscript">var jobVacancies:Array = new Array('Actionscript programmer', 'Flash developer', '3D designer');

/**
	Search the vacancies Array
	
	Parameters
	criteria:String - Search criteria string
	
	Returns
	Boolean, true on match and false if the criteria has no match
 */
function searchVacancy():Boolean
{
	if (arguments.length == 0) {
		throw new Error ('No arguments found');
	} else if (arguments.length > 1) {
		throw new Error ('Invalid number of arguments');
	} else if (typeof(arguments[0]) != 'string') {
		throw new Error ('Invalid argument type');
	} else if (arguments[0].length == 0) {
		throw new Error ('Empty criteria');
	} else {
		for (var i in jobVacancies) {
			if (jobVacancies[i] == arguments[0]) return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
}

try {
	var isAvailable:Boolean = searchVacancy(''),
		traceStr:String = isAvailable ? 'Given vacancy available!' : 'Given vacancy unavailable!';
	trace(traceStr);
} catch (e) {
	trace("Error: "+e.message+"!");
}</pre>
<p>The above code will trace <strong>Error: Empty criteria!</strong> as there's an empty String for the argument of <strong>searchVacancy</strong> function.</p>
