<p>Elisa launched <a title="First commercial UMTS900 network in the world" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/telecom/first-commercial-umts900-network-in-the-world">the first commercial UMTS900 network</a> in the world last year and put up the&nbsp;first Estonian UMTS900 test network in January. With <abbr title="Universal Mobile Telecommunications System">UMTS</abbr>&nbsp;it's possible to bring high-speed mobile internet to rural areas as the demand is very high.</p>
<p>A year ago Elisa introduced the first M-internet package of unlimited traffic. Since then its usage has grown 25 times and 80 times for high-band 3,5G. These figures are expected to be beaten in 2008.</p>
