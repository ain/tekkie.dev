<p>Somewhat unpredictable has happened in Japan â€“ Apple's Mac OS X Leopard has been way more successful than Windows Vista. </p><!--more-->
<p>According to Japanese <a href="http://bcnranking.jp/news/0711/071108_8930.html" title="Article in Japanese">Business Computer News</a> OS X sales have gone up from 15.5% to 60.5% while Windows sales fell from 75.3% down to 28.7%.</p>
<p>Such a market change makes sense as Vista's licencing policy is overwhelmingly complex and Apple has pushed out updates to its software packages quite aggressively.</p>
