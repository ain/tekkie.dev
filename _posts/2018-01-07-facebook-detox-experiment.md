Facebook is toxic. It farms people for data and feeds off reactionary content igniting polarised discussions. It delivers very little value for the time spent.<!--more-->

## The background

### Fast everything

H&M does fast fashion, McDonald's does fast food and IKEA does fast furniture. __Facebook is about fast friendships__. Unfriending works the same way as does throwing away a tee shirt that only cost 5â‚¬ to buy. Quantity over quality.

One of Hollywood's greatest, Denzel Washington, put it nicely, <q class="quote--inlined">We all want to be liked, but now we all want to be liked by 16 million</q>:

### Privacy

Facebook's success builds on privacy violations. You're in a private chat on Facebook talking about a football team you've never mentioned before and 2 minutes later you have a fan gear ad of the team in your Newsfeed. Your private data is digested and sold to the highest bidder for advertising purposes.

3 years ago in 2014 I joined @maxschrems' class act against Facebook exactly because of it.

### Negativity

Facebook provides an excellent platform for flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, trumpists. Hate speech and alternative facts distribute without control. The more people like this type of content, the more likely it is to appear on their Newsfeeds. Facebook's algorithm takes care of that. For the advertising revenue.

Your _fast friends_ are the likely distributors of such content. Any confrontations will lead to arguments concluding on a negative note.

## The experiment

Since I removed Facebook from all my mobile devices a year ago already, next steps should go further:

1. Deactivate Facebook for a quarter as of Jan 15th
2. Monitor
  - overall productivity
  - spare time for activities like sports, hobbies incl. Open Source Software contributions
  - communication with friends
  - general mood when communicating online

Until further notice: call in person, send a message.
