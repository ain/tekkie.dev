<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/typeroom_icon.png" alt="Typeroom icon" class="teaser-image--left" /> Most web sites on the web are static. They have no <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> and their owners lack skills to do the editing properly. That's the niche for <a href="http://www.typeroom.com/">Typeroom</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>The slogan says <em>simple content management</em> and does so quite rightly. You don't have to use a specific admin interface or anything like Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal. Typeroom displays it all as is and you can basically make changes right inside the page. It's web-based with no installation required and you don't need any programming or specific knowledge to use it. This is just like Microsoft Word or Pages.</p>
<p>Here's the workflow to get your static site updated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter your website address</li>
<li>Click on the item you want to change</li>
<li>Save the item</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ol>
<p>Publishing means you have 3 options: Instant Publish (<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>), Email or Download. Instant Publish is the one requiring you to sign up. Having an account costs $12 monthly with the trial period of 30 days. As the application is in the status of Private Beta, all accounts are free. </p>
<p>Here's the screenshot of the site of <a href="http://obfuscatr.flashbit.net">obfuscatr</a> in Typeroom Lite (Typeroom Professional with a number of additional features is in the development):</p>

<p>Typeroom requires Firefox or Internet Explorer (6, 7). Other browsers are not supported.</p>
