<p>While the new terminal at <abbr title="Tallinn Airport">TLL</abbr> is still in the construction, it functions well and is already loaded with travellers. In conjunction with these developments <a href="/e-stonia/estonian-air-to-introduce-e-tickets" title="Estonian Air to introduce e-tickets">Estonian Air's e-tickets</a> were launched in May and prove to be working. So in addition to open WiFi network, available throughout the terminal, you can also use the computers for free.</p><!--more-->

You can read your Google Mail, browse your feeds at Digg or do anything else on the net. The gear is provided by ML Arvutid, ISO-certified Estonian computer manufacturer since 1992 (certified as of 1998).</p>
<p>It looks like the user experience regarding the mouse trackball has been poor so they seem to be replacing these with touchscreen models as few already have that functionality.</p>
<p>Computers are equipped with ID-card readers (notice the slot above the ripped sticker) and work with <abbr title="Estonian ID card">eID</abbr>.</p>
