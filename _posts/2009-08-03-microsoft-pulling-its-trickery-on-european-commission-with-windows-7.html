excerpt: European Commission's anti-monopoly policies seem to be there for Microsoft exclusively. Even so, Microsoft has complied and done a lot to meet the regulation for European market.

Even so, Microsoft has complied and done a lot to meet the regulation for European market. This time though, it seems Microsoft is not willing to lose out and is about to outsmart EC.</p><!--more-->
<p>The argument European Commission has this time could as well be called a Continuance War of Browser Wars that <a title="End of Life for Netscape" href="/browsers/eol-for-netscape">eventually put off Netscape</a>. In particular, EC would like to see the offering of multiple browsers to European customers meaning that the Redmond software giant should provide alternatives to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Microsoft has replied to this request with Microsoft Windows 7 E, specifically targeted for European market that hasn't got Internet Explorer pre-installed, or at least that was the initial idea. Now, as the time has moved on and EC has stated that Windows without a browser is a bad idea, Microsoft has introduced a ballot screen that would make all browsers equally available to a user. Sounds most fine, but here comes the tricky part.</p>
<p>Microsoft's VP, Mr Dave Heiner, has stated thatÂ computer manufacturers and partners raised concerns regarding the introduction of Windows 7 E. They've said it would be confusing to introduce another version of Windows to the already long list of versions. Thus, what Microsoft's proposal really means, is that a newly purchased Windows 7 PC will launch with a specific ballot screen program to be installed over the internet as soon as it's set up in European Economic Area. <strong>But</strong> since the whole Windows update logic is tied to Internet Explorer, this is truly a bunch of rubbish as <strong>only those who have IE as their default browser will receive the ballot screen</strong>.</p>
<p>Thankfully enough things are not final and European Commission has yet to confirm Microsoft's proposal. Though, we don't think they are going to reject it, are we?</p>
