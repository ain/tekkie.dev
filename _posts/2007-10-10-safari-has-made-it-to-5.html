<p>Despite all that criticism and scepticism on Safari, it has finally achieved 5% threshold.</p><!--more-->
<p>This is the first time Safari has crossed 5% of the browser market share.Still, figures show that Internet Explorer is way ahead of others:</p>

<p>Since 2005 Safari's development is open source and based on <a href="http://webkit.org">The WebKit Open Source Project</a>.<br />
In 2007 Apple introduced <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari 3 Public Beta</a> that is now also available for Windows.</p>
<p>Safari was the first browser to pass Acid2, a test case announced in 2005.</p>
