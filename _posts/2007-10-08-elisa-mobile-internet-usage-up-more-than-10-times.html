<p>Vodafone partner in Estonia, Elisa, claims its mobile internet usage has grown approximately 11 times in the first half of 2007.</p><!--more-->
<p>
99% of Estonia's population lives in the coverage area of Elisa. 65% of the territory has <abbr title="Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution">EDGE</abbr> connectivity with mobile connection speeds up to 240 Kbps and approximately 30% of population lives in the 3.5G (<abbr title="High-Speed Downlink Packet Access">HSDPA</abbr>) coverage area enabling speeds up to 3.6 Mbps.</p>
<p>The growth of mobile internet usage is considered to be based on the expansion to remote areas, EDGE availability and reasonable pricing. M-Internet package with unlimited traffic is currently priced at around 15 EUR monthly. Day-ticket for M-Internet costs around 1 EUR and is valid for 12h.</p>
