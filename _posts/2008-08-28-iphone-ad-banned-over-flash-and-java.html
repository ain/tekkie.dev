<p>Advertising Standards Authority of United Kingdom, the advertising watchdog for misleading consumers, has banned the recent TV ad for the new iPhone 3G. The internet capabilities of the smart phone are claimed to be over-hyped.</p><!--more-->

<p>The ad says</p>
<blockquote><p>You never know which part of the internet you'll need ... which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone</p></blockquote>
<p>on which <abbr title="Advertising Standards Authority">ASA</abbr> received two complaints claiming it was misleading because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java, both integral to many web pages.</p>
<p>Apple excused themselves with a fact that Safari, the web browser the iPhone uses, was built to open internet standards which is true, it is based on the <a title="WebKit open source web browser engine" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/tag/webkit">WebKit framework</a>. As Flash and Java technology are not open source, compatibility with these technologies can not be ensured. Apple has referred to these technologies as "every third-party technology in the marketplace". Nevertheless ASA ordered that the TV ad must not be broadcast again in the same form.</p>
<p>Flash Player is installed on over 850 million Internet-connected desktops and mobile devices making it one of the most popular technologies to provide rich media and <a href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/category/rich-internet-applications">Rich Media Applications</a> online. The percentage of the computers having Flash Player approximates to 98%. Apple's ignorance regarding it has been obvious since the first versions of iPhone.</p>
