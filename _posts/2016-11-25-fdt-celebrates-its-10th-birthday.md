FDT, the Flexible Development Toolkit for cross-device developers, is celebrating its 10th birthday.<!--more-->

Started in 2006 by Powerflasher, an award-winning German agency, FDT has delivered Flash and AIR developers the ultimate coding comfort for a decade. In this time a number of competitive tools have ceased to exist due the Flash decline.

Today FDT finds its main audience amongst developers who are targeting iOS and Android platforms using Adobe AIR. The obvious benefit being the use of single codebase across platforms.
