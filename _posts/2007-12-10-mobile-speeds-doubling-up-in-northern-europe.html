<p>Being the first operator in Northern Europe to do so, Elisa's Estonian branch has doubled the speed of its 3.5G mobile internet.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Until now <abbr title="High-Speed Downlink Packet Access">HSDPA</abbr> connections were limited to 3.6 Mbps. New speed is 7.2 Mbps. <abbr title="High-Speed Uplink Packet Access">HSUPA</abbr> (uplink) is 1.4 Mbps which is approximately 3.5 times faster than before.</p>
<p>The above speeds are theoretical peaks that average out to 4.5 Mbps and 1 Mbps for end-users.</p>
<p>In context of <a href="/telecom/elisa-mobile-internet-usage-up-more-than-10-times" title="Elisa mobile internet usage up more than 10 times">recent sales figures</a> such an upgrade is most welcome.</p>
<p>Elisa is official Vodafone partner in Estonia.</p>
