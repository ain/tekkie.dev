<img class="teaser-image--left" title="elisa" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/elisa-logo.png" alt="elisa" width="107" height="69" />As of this week, [Elisa](https://www.elisa.ee) has the largest 3.5G coverage in Estonia. This comes as a result of the 3.5G availability for all of Tartumaa, one of the largest counties in the country.

Given the new UMTS900 technology that Elisa deploys in rural areas, this is to introduce country-wide 3.5G coverage. Since UMTS is about 3 times cheaper than the competing technologies (including HSDPA) it will also result in cheaper <abbr title="Mobile internet">M-internet</abbr> packages.

UMTS900 network speeds go up to 7.2 Mbps of downlink and 1.5 Mbps uplink.

Elisa's Finnish branch launched [first commercial UMTS900 network in the world](/telecom/first-commercial-umts900-network-in-the-world) in 2007.
