<p>Apple iPhone will receive a speed upgrade in 2008.</p><!--more-->
<p>A serious competition disadvantage for iPhone in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – low mobile speed – is going to be resolved next year, AT&amp;T Inc. Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson confirmed. AT&amp;T is the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the U.S.</p>
<p>At this point iPhone supports <abbr title="Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution">EDGE</abbr> that is considered 2.75G and lacks speed esp. in comparison with Nokia, e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=N95&amp;tag=flashtekkie-20&amp;index=electronics&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">N95</a>.</p>
<p>Long awaited news come in advance of Apple's plan of selling 10 million iPhones in 2008. In Nordic countries any <abbr title="Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution">EDGE</abbr> phone could only expect modest sales. For instance <a href="/telecom/first-commercial-umts900-network-in-the-world" title="First commercial UMTS900 network in the world">Finland announced full 3G coverage</a> to become available in 2008 just recently and Estonia already has 3.5G <abbr title="High-Speed Downlink Packet Access">HSDPA</abbr> coverage in most populated areas. So if Apple plans to expand to Northern Europe 3G compatibility would definitely be critical.</p>
<p>Apple claims they dumped 3G support over iPhone's battery life.</p>
