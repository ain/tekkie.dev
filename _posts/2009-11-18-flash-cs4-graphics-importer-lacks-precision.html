<p>Importing graphics from Adobe Illustrator to Flash is a nightmare when it comes to precision graphics. Incredibly enough, an utterly fine graphic in Illustrator may turn up all shoddy in Flash.</p><!--more-->
<p>To prove a point, here's a clip of the vector curve in Illustrator at 600% zoom:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-587" title="A curve in Adobe Illustrator CS4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/A-curve-in-Adobe-Illustrator.png" alt="A curve in Adobe Illustrator" width="400" height="143" /></p>
<p>After SWF export at maximum quality (10) and import to Flash, the very same curve looked like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-588" title="A curve in Adobe Flash CS4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/A-curve-in-Adobe-Flash.png" alt="A curve in Adobe Flash CS4" width="490" height="132" /></p>
<p>The above blue curve is fine and basically identical to the one in Illustrator, but the object that should actually fit to the curve (notice the brown area) makes a truly shoddy object.</p>
<p>In order to get back to the original curve, quite a few curvepoints had to be removed and handles severely adjusted in Flash itself.</p>
<p>The rumour says that Flash CS5 will bring changes in Text Layout Engine, introduce iPhone exporter and a lot of optimisations as did the most <a title="First impressions on Flash Player 10.1 prerelease and AIR 2 beta" href="/flash/first-impressions-on-flash-player-10-1-prerelease-and-air-2-beta">recent AIR and Flash Player updates</a>. Let's hope that CS5 will also improve the precision of the graphics parser. It really should.</p>
