<p>To emphasize greater use of Cascading Style Sheets â€” there are few very good reasons to dump endless HTML table structures in favour of CSS.</p><!--more-->
<p>[ad#medium-rectangle]Tableless design (or layout) is a design technique that leaves out HTML tables and uses CSS to arrange elements on a web page.</p>
<p>To illustrate the point let's introduce 2 different samples of fluid 3-column design: <a title="Table design" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/tmp/table_design.html">tables</a> vs <a title="Tableless design" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/tmp/tableless_design.html">tableless</a>.</p>
<p>Visually there's absolutely no difference. Yet technically speaking, for this very simple page in structure, you can spot a 5-line difference and approximately 200 bytes in favour of tableless design. That leads us to the benefits:</p>
<h3>Bandwidth &amp; rendering</h3>
<p>Tableless design means less bandwidth. If you link in a CSS file, a browser will cache it on 1st load of a page and on further navigation only page structure itself is being downloaded. In addition to traffic cuts it significantly reduces page latency as well.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Prioritizing Cascading Style Sheets will also ease the process of porting a site to various platforms, e.g. mobile phones, handhelds, etc. or usage, e.g. printing. Not to mention making the site reachable for a screen reader or braille device.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>With CSS site layout is kept apart from its structure and is centralized. That makes site design a lot easier to change. For example changing 1 single digit in CSS may increase or decrease font size of an headline on each and every page of a site.<br />
CSS is a reusable resource as opposed to the inline definitions of HTML.</p>
<p>And for all tableless developers there are badges you can add to a site to indicate its quality:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/csstableless.gif" alt="CSS tableless button 1" /> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tableless2.gif" alt="CSS tableless button 2" /></p>
