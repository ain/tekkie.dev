<p>As Mac OS X Leopard arrives in 7 days time on 26th, Mozilla developers are not staying behind. New Firefox theme for Mac OS X  is a work in progress.<br />
<!--more--><br />
New Mac OS introduces a whole bunch of changes not only on application side but on the interface side as well. New skinning is somewhat cleaner and more subtle than it was for the Tiger. We can see it on iTunes which is a significant visual achievement compared to the one currently on Safari.</p>
<p>Firefox skinning on Mac has been more like the one you can see in Linux version rather than in Windows. Yet it is a totally different environment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest updates on Firefox 3 for Mac talk about considerable progress in design. We can see it transforming into something that looks more native on a Mac:</p>

<p>Let's all hope the theme finds a way to the final release of Firefox 3.</p>
