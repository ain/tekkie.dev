<p>Beta 3 of Firefox 3 is now out. Quite a few new features and a new look.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h3>New skin</h3>
<p>Finally some nice interface improvements have hit us backing up the statement from October last year predicting that <a title="Firefox 3 going Macish" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/mac-os/firefox-3-going-macish">Firefox might be going Macish</a>. And here it is looking very much like Safari:</p>
<p><a title="Firefox 3 Beta 3 screenshot" rel="lightbox" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/picture-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-2.thumbnail.png" alt="Firefox 3 Beta 3 screenshot" /></a></p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Mozilla has introduced Identity Verification with the company name you're connected to right in front of the location bar. That's for sites that use <abbr title="Extended Validation">EV</abbr> SSL certificates:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-1.png" alt="Connected company" /></p>
<p>Also, there's now Malware detection that triggers on sites which are known to install viruses, spyware, trojans or other malware:</p>

<h3>Things gone easier</h3>
<p>Beta 3 features renewed Download Manager. In addition to the advanced search, download progress is now displayed in the status bar as well:</p>

<p>Bookmarking has also improved. Wherever you are at you can now bookmark a page with a single click by clicking on a star that appears in the location bar (double click fires up the window with specs):</p>

<p>Typing into the location bar is now driven by the <abbr title="recency + frequency">frecency</abbr> score:</p>
<p><a title="Frecency in the location bar" rel="lightbox" href="http://tekkie.flashbit.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/picture-5.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-5.thumbnail.png" alt="Frecency in the location bar" /></a></p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Beta 3 also introduces huge performance improvements with major architectural revisions. Over 90 changes have been made in addition to the ones in Beta 2 just to gain in performance. In addition to those 90 changes, over 350 individiual memory leaks have been plugged and memory use optimisation  is ongoing.</p>
<p>As even Firefox 3 Beta 1 was significantly faster than any of the Firefox 2 releases, this is again a huge leap forward.</p>
