<p><img class="teaser-image--left" title="Adobe Extension Manager" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-8.png" alt="Adobe Extension Manager" width="127" height="120" />If you run English Flash CS4 on a non-English system you might have noticed that Flash components installed with Adobe Extension Manager don't turn up in Components panel anymore. It's another bug vs feature situation by Adobe.</p>
<p>The thing is Extension Manager pushes all extensions to the language-specific folder given the system settings. Flash on the other hand seeks for the components by its own settings and there you have it.</p><!--more-->
<p>To fix this anomaly you've got to get Extensions hooked up to Flash:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down both, Flash and Extension Manager</li>
<li>Start Flash</li>
<li>In Flash go to the menu <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Extensions...</strong></li>
<li>Extension Manager starts up</li>
<li>Tick the checkboxes of the Extensions you need to be there in Flash</li>
<li>Quit Extension Manager and restart Flash</li>
</ol>
<p>This is tested to work on Mac OS and is reported to work on Windows as well.</p>
