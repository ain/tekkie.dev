<p>Google has invested quite some effort in bringing their Best Of closer to iPhone users using the same tech gear as in GMail, Calendar or Reader â€“ <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr>. The whole framework is highly optimized for <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" title="Download the latest version of Safari">Safari</a>, iPhone's web browser. Indeed a huge acknowledgement of WebKit developers' work.</p>
<p>My Location Beta, one of the applications in a bundle, is another great product by Google that <strong>can locate you</strong> on Google Maps <strong>with or without GPS</strong>:</p>
