<p>Estonian Informatics Centre has announced a public procurement for additional ID-card development to officially provide support for alternative platforms.</p><!--more-->
<p>The development brings ID-card software to Mac OS and to the majority of the Linux distributions.  For Linux <abbr title="Estonian Information Centre">EIC</abbr> aims to get it  into the installation packages.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"With this step the state clearly shows that ID-card and Mobile-ID should be a part of our everyday lives as is locking the doors if we step out," said EIC's representative Riho Oks. "ID-card should be accessible for all despite the skills of the person or the preferences on operating systems"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The development is just a part of the campaign towards improving the awareness of ID-card and Mobile-ID systems as well as providing the necessary equipment (e.g. card readers) for the entire public sector.</p>
<p>Estonian ID-card acts as a legitimate identification document and is widely used by Estonians as a travel document across EU. It can also be used and is highly recommended for online banking, public transport and signing the documents to name a few. Half of the population has the card.</p>
<p>The support for alternative platforms is currently provided by a third party (<a href="http://ideelabor.ee">Ideelabor OÃœ</a>) as Open Source Software.</p>
