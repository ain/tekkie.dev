A new version of [obfuscatr](https://obfuscatr.flashbit.net) email obfuscation widget introduces support for `+` addresses, e.g. `john+newsletters@company.com`.<!--more-->

> **DISCLAIMER**: Apple discontinued Dashboard in macOS Catalina. obfuscatr widget can not be installed on newer macOS versions.[^1]

Somewhat a forced update by obfuscatr users, it is still a minor update and does not add much to the latest release of 1.1.0 introduced by Flashbit precisely a year ago.

`+` addresses can be used with a Google Mail account making Google pretty much responsible for its increased use. Many companies use + addresses for their support ticketing system given the format support+230129043@company.com. As this format makes email filtering very easy to handle it's a must for any email-related system.

[obfuscatr 1.2.0](https://obfuscatr.flashbit.net/download.html#v1.2.0) is a Mac OS X Dashboard widget available as a free download. [obfuscatr 1.1.0 was featured on Macworld Italy's complimentary CD](/mac-os/obfuscatr-featured-in-macworld).
