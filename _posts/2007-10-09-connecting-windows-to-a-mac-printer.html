<p>Connecting your Windows PC to a printer behind a Mac sounds like a lot of trouble. The thing is it takes 15 seconds if you know what you are doing.</p><!--more-->
<p>Firstly you have to configure your Mac to share the printer:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Print &amp; Fax preferences, click Sharing.</li>
<li>Select the "Share these printers with other computers" checkbox, and then select the printers you wish to share.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" /></li>
<li>Click Show All, click Sharing, and then click Services.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" /></li>
<li>Select the "Printer Sharing" checkbox</li>
</ol>
<p>Next thing is to get Windows to connect to Mac. The easiest way is to install Bonjour, a piece of free software by Apple.</p>
<p>Bonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers.</p>
