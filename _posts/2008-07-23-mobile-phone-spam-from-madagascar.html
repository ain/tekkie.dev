<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-173" title="WARNING!!!" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/warning.png" alt="" width="157" height="137" />During the 2-day period of 16th - 17th July thousands of Estonian mobile clients received a call from a Madagascar number: +261229600191. Those who missed the call and called back at that number were charged 1,63 € per minute.</p>
<p>Elisa, the operator discovering the spam, advises to not to answer the calls from unknown foreign numbers or return any of such missed calls. </p>
<p>You are all welcome to report your experiences regarding it.</p>
