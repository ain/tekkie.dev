<p>All the speculations about <abbr title="Google Phone">gPhone</abbr> should now be concluded. Google has thought bigger than just another iPhone.</p><!--more-->
<p>Instead of a phone The Open Handset Alliance is developing the first complete, open and free mobile platform – Android. Alongside Google there are more than 29 technology and mobile companies behind it all and most importantly Android is <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> that eliminates any boundaries of application availability for this mobile operating system. This is also the reason why Google has introduced Android Developer Challenge providing $10 million in awards for great apps built on the Android platform.</p>
<p>At this point the platform features 3D rendering, Google Maps™, address book, text messaging and browser which is in fact based on WebKit.</p>
<p>See the demo below:</p>
