<p>Performances from the best Estonian artists and DJs include local Hip Hop legends <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djcritikalestonia">DJ Critikal</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/pauloja">DJ Paul Oja</a>. Hostess of the event will be Heidy Purga. The entrance to the event will be granted for the first 1 000 registrants who email their name and mobile number at <a href="mailto:iphone@emt.ee">iphone@emt.ee</a>.</p>
<p>First official iPhone in Estonia will be sold at midnight, yet the pricing of the phone remains uncertain even though it is rumoured that TeliaSonera's Estonian branch, EMT, will sell it at a significantly higher price than in Sweden.</p>
