Despite all that criticism and scepticism on Safari, it has finally achieved 5% threshold.<!--more-->

This is the first time Safari has crossed 5% of the browser market share.Still, figures show that Internet Explorer is way ahead of others:

Since 2005 Safari's development is open source and based on [The WebKit Open Source Project](https://webkit.org).

In 2007 Apple introduced [Safari 3 Public Beta](https://www.apple.com/safari/) that is now also available for Windows.

Safari was the first browser to pass Acid2, a test case announced in 2005.
