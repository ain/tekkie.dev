Creating disk images for sharing your stuff with people on the same platform is just one of them.</p><!--more-->
<p>For creating an image of our beloved pics, we are going to use <strong>Disk Utility</strong> residing in <strong>Applications &gt; Utilities</strong> folder of your Mac:</p>
<p><a title="Screenshot of Disk Utility" rel="lightbox" href="/assets/uploads/2008/12/disk-utility-screenshot.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-221" title="Screenshot of Disk Utility" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/disk-utility-screenshot-150x115.png" alt="" width="150" height="115" /></a></p>
<p>As you can tell, there's <strong>New Image</strong> icon on the toolbar. Clicking that gives us a pop-up:</p>
<p><a title="Disk Utility pop-up for the new image" rel="lightbox" href="/assets/uploads/2008/12/disk-utility-pop-up-for-the-new-image.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-222" title="Disk Utility pop-up for the new image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/disk-utility-pop-up-for-the-new-image-150x125.png" alt="" width="150" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>From there we need to set the *.dmg filename for <strong>Save As</strong>, <strong>Volume Name</strong> as it would appear once attached amongst your disk drives andÂ estimated size of the shared stuff for the <strong>Volume Size</strong>. That's the basic stuff you need to know. Make sure you leave <strong>Image Format</strong> to <strong>read/write</strong>.</p>
<p>As you hit <strong>Create</strong>, the blank image will be created, in the circumstances to Pictures folder, and mounted so that it will appear amongst the devices in Finder:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" title="Mounted DMG image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mounted-dmg.png" alt="" width="235" height="64" /></p>
<p><a title="Files on the DMG image" rel="lightbox" href="/assets/uploads/2008/12/files-on-the-dmg.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-224" title="Files on the DMG image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files-on-the-dmg-150x25.png" alt="" width="150" height="25" /></a> Now all you have to do is to drag files onto that image. Click it to see its contents and just drag the files you needed to share into it.</p>
<p>And there you have it. Anyone receiving that DMG file will be able to mount it by double-clicking and can use the files on that DMG image.</p>
<p>One could say zipping is much faster and convenient but as soon as you come to loads of collab-related stuff you need to share, zip creates a lot of hassle with folders and isn't nearly as mobile as DMG. Keeping track of DMG revisions and modifying it is much more convenient.</p>
