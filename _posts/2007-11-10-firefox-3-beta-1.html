<p>1st beta of Firefox 3 for Mac is out. Compared to earlier releases it has improved a lot in terms of bug fixes, looks and speed.</p><!--more-->
<p>For a start Beta 1 doesn't crash. In addition to this 'insignificant' improvement there are few more:</p>
<h3>Acid2</h3>
<p>Good news for developers â€“ Firefox now passes <abbr title="A test case designed to identify web page rendering flaws">Acid2</abbr>. <a title="Acid2 Browser Test" href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/">Click here</a> to take the test.</p>
<h3>Rendering performance</h3>
<p><abbr title="Firefox"></abbr>A lot of speed in this release. Gran Paradisos didn't even come close and it actually seems faster than <a title="WebKit open source web browser engine" href="http://webkit.org">WebKit</a>.</p>
<h3>Smart cards</h3>
<p>Version 2 of Firefox broke a lot of sites that employed smart card readers. Thankfully this is not the case in this build. Everything seems to work properly.</p>
<h3>Looks</h3>
<p>Like for the alphas, controls have got this Aqua feel now that all the macheads are used to. Toolbars don't exactly look like expected (see <a href="/mac-os/firefox-3-going-macish">Firefox 3 going Macish</a>) but you can spot the slight changes:</p>
<p><a title="Firefox 3 Beta 1 screenshot" rel="lightbox" href="/assets/uploads/2007/11/firefox-3-beta-1.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/firefox-3-beta-1.thumbnail.png" alt="Firefox 3 Beta 1 screenshot" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, no significant <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> developments. No <a title="Web Fonts support in WebKit" href="/browsers/webkit-is-leading-the-run-for-css3">Web Fonts</a>. And there are still some rendering bugs, e.g. text-decoration.</p>
