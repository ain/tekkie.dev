<p>The following has already been listed as a feature request at Adobe Bug System and is only to illustrate the situation which is basically the lack of badly needed functionality in ActionScript 3.</p>
<p>The problem relates to <code>flash.geom.PerspectiveProjection</code> introduced with the load of native 3D in Flash 10.</p><!--more-->
<h3>The situation</h3>
<ol>
<li>The object is added to the stage with the defined x, y, z, rotationX, rotationY and rotationZ properties.</li>
<li>For a better 3D impression, perspective projection is applied.</li>
<li>After all transformations on-screen size of the object is required.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The code</h3>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1894840.js?file=PPPlane.as"></script></p>
<p>The code is illustrative and self-explanatory: <code>addPerspective()</code> method adds perspective projection and <code>visibleBitmapBounds()</code> returns a Rectangle with visible bounds of the object.</p>
<h3>The result and the problem</h3>
<p>Depending on the stage size, the result is the blue 3D-rotated plane in the perspective alongside the traceback:</p>
<pre lang="none">Plane size: 274x365
Plane bounds: (x=256, y=209, w=274, h=365)
Visible, on-screen bounds of the Plane: (x=258, y=215, w=171, h=287)</pre>
<p>Plane size and bounds are correct to what it is without perspective transformations, but they don't help with the size of an object on screen.</p>
<p>So what is currently missing from ActionScript 3 entirely, is the means to get visible bounds of the DisplayObject that has perspective projection. It is especially painful if the object can't be output to stage for measuring (<code>visibleBitmapBounds()</code>).</p>
<p><strong>If any math geniuses have a better way to get visible bounds of the object with perspective projection, you're most welcome to share it!</strong></p>
