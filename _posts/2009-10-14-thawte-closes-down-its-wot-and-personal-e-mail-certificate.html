<p><img class="teaser-image--left" title="Encrypted" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/encrypted.png" alt="Encrypted" width="128" height="128" />Thawte, a leading global SSL certificate authority, announced today that the Thawte Personal E-mail Certificates* and WoT (Web of Trust)** are being discontinued.</p>
<p>What it basically means, is that many users enjoying Thawte's free email certificates at this point, will be left in the dark after November 16th, 2009.</p><!--more-->
<p>Users of Thawte E-mail certificates have received an email explaining the occasion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite our strong desire to continue providing the Thawte Personal E-mail Certificate and Web of Trust services, the ever-expanding standards and technology requirements will outpace our ability to maintain these services at the high level of quality we require.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; ">To express its gratitude to all affected members of the Thawte community, Thawte is issuing $100 off the purchase price of their SSL and/or code signing certificates. In addition to this offer, Thawte has introduced a special arrangement with VeriSign regarding replacing Thawte Personal E-mail Certificate: VeriSign's exclusive offer for a FREE 1-year replacement personal email certificate - a $19.95 value. This offer will be open for 2 months after the service is discontinued and will no longer be available after January 16, 2010.<br />
All users who have received an appropriate email from Thawte are eligible for the offers. </span></p>
<p><small>* E-mail certificates allow encrypting emails and signing them in order to indicate sender's authenticity.<br />
** Web of Trust (WoT) was a Certification system that allowed your identity to be validated for use in your Personal Certificate. Only the affiliated network of notaries were empowered to authenticate your identity in person.</small></p>
