<p>During the development of any portal site one should consider basic wording in the critical parts of the hierarchy, e.g. the main branches of the site appearing in site paths. Since these matters can be most confusing at the times, Search Engine Optimisation techniques can come to rescue.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this case it's the casino site that deals with funding possibilities of various casinos and poker rooms with a link to eWallets. The wording possibilities are <strong>payment method</strong> vs <strong>payment option</strong> vs <strong>deposit method</strong> vs <strong>deposit option</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>So how could <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> help in the circumstances? Well, wouldn't it be nice to have a wording that provides most references from Google? It is the reasoning behind the following research.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Given the above mentioned 4 terms we are going to find out what is the most indexed term by the largest casino and poker related sites in Google.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2009/01/most-used-term-for-casino-funding.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-284" title="Most used term for casino funding research" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/most-used-term-for-casino-funding-300x144.png" alt="Most used term for casino funding research" width="300" height="144" /></a><br />
<a href="/assets/uploads/2009/01/most-used-term-for-casino-funding.pdf" style="font-size:10px;">link to the PDF file of the research</a> </p>
<p>As you can tell from the above chart, the wording varies in between the different casinos but the word to use here clearly has to do with <strong>deposit</strong>.</p>
<p>Another interesting matter is that it seems like <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/?key=MDAwMDFCNzAwMDAwM0U5NDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDA-">Full Tilt Poker</a>, <a href="http://www.pokerroom.com/?ref=44571">PokerRoom</a> and PokerStars are the best performers <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>-wise having all the terms indexed while other great casino sites are poorly indexed or not indexed at all, e.g. bwin. Must be somewhat a huge drawback, no?</p>
