Apple's new MacBook Pro delivers more than the new M1 chip. Something good is back for the developers.<!--more-->

Having tested the first MacBook Pro with Touch Bar back in 2017, it felt like [MacBook was dropping developers](/apple/macbook/macbook-is-dropping-developers). Some essential ergonomics got disrupted esp. for the Vim-based devs.

Today, not only has Apple made a prominent switch to their own M1 chips and tripled the performance[^1] by doing so, they've also brought back the `Esc` key. Did Apple's designers listen to the critique? Perhaps.
